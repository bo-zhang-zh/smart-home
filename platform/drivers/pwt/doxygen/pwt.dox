@defgroup pwt_driver PWT: Pulse Width Timer
@details The KSDK provides a driver for the Pulse Width Timer (PWT)
         of Kinetis devices.

# Function groups {#PWTFunc}
The FTM driver supports the generation of PWM signals, input capture, dual edge
capture, output compare, and quadrature decoder modes. The driver also supports
configuring each of the FTM fault inputs.

## Initialization and deinitialization {#PWTInit}
The function FTM_Init() initializes the FTM with specified configurations. The function
FTM_GetDefaultConfig() gets the default configurations. The initialization function
configures the FTM for the requested register update mode for registers with buffers.
It also sets up the FTM's fault operation mode and FTM behavior in BDM mode.

The function FTM_Deinit() disables the FTM counter and turns off the module clock.

## PWM Operations {#FTMPwmOperation}
The function FTM_SetupPwm()  sets up FTM channels for PWM output. The function
can set up the PWM signal properties for multiple channels. Each channel has its
own duty cycle and level-mode specified. However, the same PWM period and
PWM mode is applied to all channels requesting the PWM output. The signal duty cycle is
provided as a percentage of the PWM period. Its value should be between 0 and 100
0=inactive signal(0% duty cycle) and 100=always active signal (100% duty cycle).

The function FTM_UpdatePwmDutycycle() updates the PWM signal duty cycle
of a particular FTM channel.

The function FTM_UpdateChnlEdgeLevelSelect() updates the level select bits of a
particular FTM channel. This can be used to disable the PWM output when making changes
to the PWM signal.

## Input capture operations {#FTMInpOperation}
The function FTM_SetupInputCapture() sets up an FTM channel for input capture.
The user can specify the capture edge and a filter value to be used when processing
the input signal.

The function FTM_SetupDualEdgeCapture() can be used to measure the pulse width of
a signal. A channel pair is used during capture with the input signal coming
through a channel n. The user can specify whether to use one-shot or continuous capture,
the capture edge for each channel, and any filter value to be used when processing the
input signal.

## Output compare operations {#FTMCompOperation}
The function FTM_SetupOutputCompare() sets up an FTM channel for output compare.
The user can specify the channel output on a successful comparison and a comparison
value.

## Quad decode  {#FTMQuadOperation}
The function FTM_SetupQuadDecode() sets up FTM channels 0 and 1 for quad decoding.
The user can specify the quad decoding mode, polarity, and filter properties for each input
signal.

## Fault operation  {#FTMFaultOperation}
The function FTM_SetupFault() sets up the properties for each fault. The user can specify
the fault polarity and whether to use a filter on a fault input. The overall fault filter value and
fault control mode are set up during initialization.

## Status {#FTMStatus}
Provides functions to get and clear the FTM status.

## Interrupt {#FTMInterrupt}
Provides functions to enable/disable FTM interrupts and get current enabled interrupts.


# Register Update  {#FTMRegUp}
Some of the FTM registers have buffers. The driver support various methods to
update these registers with the content of the register buffer. The registers can be
updated using the PWM synchronized loading or an intermediate point loading.
The update mechanism for register with buffers can be specified through the
following fields available in the configuration structure.
~~~~~{.c}
    uint32_t pwmSyncMode;
    uint32_t reloadPoints;
~~~~~
Multiple PWM synchronization update modes can be used by providing an OR'ed list of options
available in the enumeration ::ftm_pwm_sync_method_t to the pwmSyncMode field.

When using an intermediate reload points, the PWM synchnronization is not required. Multiple
reload points can be used by providing an OR'ed list of options available in the
enumeration ::ftm_reload_point_t to the reloadPoints field.

The driver initialization function sets up the appropriate bits in the FTM module based on
the register update options selected.

If software PWM synchronization is used, the below function can be used to initiate
a software trigger
~~~~~{.c}
	FTM_SetSoftwareTrigger(FTM0, true)
~~~~~


# Typical use case {#PWTCase}

## PWM output {#FTMPWMOutput}
Output a PWM signal on 2 FTM channels with different duty cycles. Periodically update the
PWM signal duty cycle.
